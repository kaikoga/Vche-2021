# Contributing to Vche

## Code style / Git stuff

We expect software engineers to read and write English.
Therefore, all code excluding localized views and resources, source code comments, and git commit messages must be in English.

## Issues, Pull Requests, Other GitHub stuff

Titles and bodies of Issues and Pull Requests are preferred to be in 日本語 within the GitHub repository, but English is acceptable.

Development takes place on `develop`, so cutting branches from `develop` is a good first step.

Contributions must pass all builds, if existing, to be accepted.
